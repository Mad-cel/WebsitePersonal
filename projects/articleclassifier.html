        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>AI-generated article detection is a class project I have participated during CS454 
            which aim to determine the difference between AI-generated academic article and human-written academic articles
            The goal for this project is to gain access to research papers / code bases and analyze them to figure out 
            approximately how much of them are AI generated. This is to raise awareness about how much thoughtless generation might be going on in academia.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Datasets consists of 50 human-written papers and 50 AI-generated papers. Only papers published before 2016 were selected
                avoid the possible uses of LLM models. The AI articles are generated using GPT4 which is the newest LLM model 
                by Open AI at the time. All generated-paper were prompted with different topic, but similiar in format: at least 1500 words and in acadmical tunes
        </p>

        <p>
            There are several feature were considered to be the determine factors between an AI-generated and human-written paper.
            Those features includes average sentence length, average word length, comma frequency, punctuation frequency, unique word count and 
            Zipf ratio. The Zipf ratio is a pattern that results from human writting where the frequency of a word correlates with a specific ratio of 
            its usage compare to the ither words. 
        </p>
