        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>AI-generated article detection is a class project I have participated during CS454 
            which aim to determine the difference between AI-generated academic article and human-written academic articles
            The goal for this project is to gain access to research papers / code bases and analyze them to figure out 
            approximately how much of them are AI generated. This is to raise awareness about how much thoughtless generation might be going on in academia.</p>
